# Churn Predict Pro
An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence assignment that uses a Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptron model to predict the churn rate of a company's customers by Naa Lamiorkor Boye

# Introduction
According to Mailchimp (n.d.), "Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing your business's products or services during a certain period of time. Your customer churn rate indicates how many of your existing customers are not likely to make another purchase from your business."
It is an essential concern of a business as its customers determine its revenue and profit. When a company knows what would cause its customers to stop purchasing their products or services, it can make careful decisions to prevent that problem.
